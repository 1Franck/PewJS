##PewJS

PewJS is a tiny HTML5 Canvas framework for games and animations.

**Why ?**

Iâ€™ve been experimenting a lot with canvas/js lately and found myself writing over and over the same bunch of codes to make it working properly, before even being able to start writing the game/animation codes. I decided to create PewJS mainly because i wanted to reuse easily the same bunch of codes from a project to another and create a straightforward modular structure for my experiments. 

**What it do ?**

 - handle animations frame rate and loop inside scene(s)
 - handle multiple canvas layers
 - handle loading/storing resources like image or audio
 - handle sprites resources and animation
 - catch keyboard inputs event, mouse events and cursor position

**What it don't:**

 - program a game for you
 - your laundry
